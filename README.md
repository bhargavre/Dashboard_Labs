# LATEST ASSIGNMENT - 7 “The financial markets do not punish security breaches.”


## Introduction
The 2017 Cost of Data Breach Study shows that $141 is the average cost per lost or stolen records and $3.62 million is the average total cost of data breach. The costs include law suit costs, the payment needed to be made to customers who lost data and also cost to take measures for the breach.
This might lead us to believe that a data breach costs the company a lot of money and has to have a big effect on the share holder's belief of the company.


## About this visualization 

This visualization is created to support the claim that the financial markets do not punish the security breaches.


## Redesign Goal

The Goal here is to redesign the previously made dashboard to a more comprehensive and perceptive visualization.


## About the previous visualization

https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_24462/Dashboard3?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes

IT is an amazing visualization that shows overall data records stolen vs the share price without the clutter of the first. The bar graph shows us the percentage and number of companies in each of the categories of how the breach changed their share price. If we ignore the no-data and breaches before IPO then we can see that only in 20% of the companies there was a decrease in share price and for the rest of the companies the share price was either same or it increased. From this graph we can also say that the increase in overall stock is due to the performance of the companies and not due to data breaches.

However, this does not really show the change in stock due to data breaches for companies to completely solidify the claim.


## The Redesigned visualization

(Tableau link here)

This visualization is simply an extension of the previous visualization as there is a addition of companies whose stock price has incurred change around the data breach period. This particular example charts show that 
+ Apple's and Facebook's share price continued to increase despite of data breach.
+ MSpy's share price was stable despite the data breach.
+ Talktalk showed that it was hit badly in terms of stock price during the year of data breach. This does not conclude or refute the claim entirely, as the claim is about a general question which is 'do security breaches really affect stock prices?'. This is one of the very few companies that has showed sudden and drastic decline in the stock prices.

## Conclusion

Data breaches is simply not cared about as we can gather from the news.
We can also say that the companies whose share price decreased were really outliers and financial market does not really punish security breaches.

“The financial markets do not punish security breaches.”

The 2017 Cost of Data Breach Study shows that $141 is the average cost per lost or stolen records and $3.62 million is the average total cost of data breach. The costs include law suit costs, the payment needed to be made to customers who lost data and also cost to take measures for the breach.  

This might lead us to believe that a data breach costs the company a lot of money and has to have a big effect on the share holder's belief of the company. Let us see if this is the case by observing the share price before and after a data breach.

The first dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/LabAssignment3/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes
shows the share price variation during a breach for all the companies. A first glace shows that there is no visible effect of the breaches on share prices. But the graph is too crowded with too much data.

The second dashboard:https://public.tableau.com/views/LabAssignment3/Dashboard2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes
picks up 4 companies which have had their share prices differently affected by data breaches. Apple and Facebook shows a constant increase in their share price irrespective of the breach. TalkTalk on the other had was affected badly while MSPYX didnt show any change at all. From this graph we get a hint as to how the data breach may not affect stock price. So it would be intersting to see how many companies fall in each of these categories.

The third and final dashboard:https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_24462/Dashboard3?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes
shows the overall data records stolen vs the share price without the clutter of the first. The bar graph shows us the percentage and number of companies in each of the categories of how the breach changed their share price. If we ignore the no-data and breaches before IPO then we can see that only in 20% of the companies there was a decrease in share price and for the rest of the companies the share price was either same or it increased. From this graph we can also say that the increase in overall stock is due to the performance of the companies and not due to data breaches. Data breaches is simply not cared about as we can gather from the news.

In conclusion, We can say that the companies whose share price decreased were really outliers and financial market does not really punish security breaches. 



ASSIGNMENT
Lab 2 - “Security breaches are becoming less severe”

Intermediate Version 1: https://public.tableau.com/views/labassignment2/Dashboard2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes

Final Version: https://public.tableau.com/views/labassignment2/Sheet4?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes

This Final graph, shows the increase in severity of data breaches over the years.  SSN, Email Addresses and Bank account information theft has seemed to increase in 2017, which shows a concern and an immediate action needed to be taken. The reason for this graph is to show that data breach is becoming more severe and specifically which details are being stolen.

Conclusion: The security breaches for certain kinds of data leaks are becoming more severe.
